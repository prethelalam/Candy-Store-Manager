# Candy-Store-Manager
I built a candy storage management program using C++ in Visual Studio Code.

# Reflection

## Introduction/Purpose:
I utilized a text editor called Visual Studio Code to build a candy store management program using the programming language C++. This program allowed me to take in new customer information and store it in text files, update existing customer information, create and display menus for candy prices, and store/update/restock inventory for 2 kinds of candy menus (Diet and Normal menu). This program will also display a specific menu based on how much an existing customer has spent previously. I learned how to create functions where I passed information through them. I also learned how to store functions in variables, how to return values properly, how to create text files, and reading and writing/storing information in text files. Lastly, I learned how to convert integers into floats and doubles, and utilize boolean expressions properly.

## Problems I ran into:
The first problem I ran into was creating a text file. I was having so difficulty understanding how I could create one and then write/store information in the file. I was able to figure out this issue by utilizing google and learning how to properly write the code. The next issue I ran into was passing information through functions. I was having difficulty doing it initially but after learning about how functions work, and once doing so I was able to properly create parameter to pass information through the functions. The next issue I had was reading information from text files. I resolved this issue by using the getline function. Next I had trouble updating my inventory based on how much candy the user has selected. I solved this problem by creating a function called UpdateNormalInventory and UpdatedietInventory, and passing in the updated inventory amounts a couple of previous functions that I created, such as CreatNormalInventory and CreateDietInventory. 

## Conclusion:
My takeaways from creating this candy store management program is to make sure I learn more about C++ concepts. I believe that I need to gain a better understanding of the foundational CS concepts in order to code better and more efficently. For my future projects, I am going to dedicate more time into learning and truly understand these concepts before starting a project.
